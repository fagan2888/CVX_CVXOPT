CVX_CVXOPT
==========

This repository contains the examples and exercises used part of the module "Convex Optimization with CVX and CVXOPT"
which I taught as part of the *15.S60 Software Tools For Operations Research* Course at MIT in January of 2013. 


The code is organized as follows:
 - Lecture Slides contains .ppt and .pdf versions of the slides.
 - CVX_Scripts contains templates and exercises for students
 - Solutions contains the solutions to those exercises
 - CVXOPT contains both problems and solutions for CVXPY and CVXOPT
 - Teaching tools contains other miscellany for generating the slides and creating a lecture.
